Welcome to the rest of your life!!!

This Django project is cool and extremely disruptive. It may even learn you a thing or two about whale morphology!

## Starting from the Terminal

In case you want to run your Django application from the terminal just run:

1) Run syncdb command to sync models to database and create Django's default superuser and auth system

    $ python manage.py migrate

2) Run Django

    $ python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT
    
## Configuration

Configuration!

## Conflagration

Sets an enemy aflame, inflicting 28800 Fire damage over 10 sec. and sending it into a state of panic. While the target is affected, the flames periodically scorch its nearby allies for 270 damage as well.

## Support & Documentation

Django docs can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/
